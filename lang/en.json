This works best if Mr. Johnson provided the hash value to them, but in a pinch the search can be done with the character’s best guess. The threshold is 1 if you have a hash value from Mr. Johnson or some other source, 4 if you are doing the best on your own. Meeting the threshold means you have narrowed the number of possibly matching files down to 32; for every net hit, that number is divided in half (so there are 16 files with 1 net hit, 8 with 2, etc.). If the number of possible matches still seems too large after the initial test, the test can be repeated with the –2 dice pool penalty for repeating an action (see p. 36).

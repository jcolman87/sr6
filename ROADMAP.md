# Roadmap
What follows is a brief overview of the planned feature roadmap for this system. These are my intended priorities, and map to the Milestones I have set up for the project under Issues.

Contributors are not asked to strictly adhere to this roadmap, however I make no promises as to when (or if) I will be able to test and review pull requests that fall outside the bounds of the next milestone.

### 1.0: Core Rulebook
The focus for the initial release is compatibility with the content of the Genesys Core Rulebook. _Most_ homebrew should work fine with this, but significant departures from the Core Rulebook's game mechanics likely will not be.

### 1.1: Expanded Player's Guide
The focus for this release will be adding support for new or alternative elements introduced by the Expanded Player's Guide.

### 1.2: First-Party Settings
The focus for this release will be adding support for new or alternative elements introduced by first-party setting guides published by Edge. This includes Terrinoth, Beanstalk, and Crucible, with other first-party settings coming sometime after they release.

### 1.3: Community Features
The focus for this release will be supporting the community's most-requested functionality and adjustments, as well as supporting homebrew & third-party releases that are particularly notable in the community.

Less common third party & homebrew functionality is the domain of modules; part of the work for this milestone is ensuring that typing data is available, and that user modules are straightforward to develop (as straightforward as Foundry modules can be, at least).

### 1.4: Automation
The focus for this release will be increasing the system's support for automation of mechanics and gameplay features.

    Pretty and deadly are not mutually exclusive. Fichetti gunsmithing combined with
    Tiffani style makes the Needler the single most popular designer handgun in the
    world. The base model is matte grey, but its special color-changing coating can
    be manipulated via wireless signal with an infinite number of patterns and designs.
    The coating allows your gun to match your shoes, your handbag, or the camo pattern
    of your fatigues. The Needler only chambers caseless flechette rounds, which are
    already factored into its damage code. Wireless bonus: You can change the color
    of the Fichetti Tiffani Needler with a Minor Action. Applying a camouflage pattern
    to the Needler increases the concealability threshold by 1 for visual Perception
    tests.'

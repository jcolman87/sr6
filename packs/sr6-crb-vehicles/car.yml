  description: 'The Bulldog is everywhere. As one of the best-selling delivery vans around the world, thanks to the protection of built-in armor, this van is also a staple of runners who enjoy the protection and anonymity of this abundant hauler. It has plenty of space for gear, drones, packages, or a few trolls. With the right paint job, it can blend in anywhere.'

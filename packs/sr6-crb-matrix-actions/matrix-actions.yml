  description: This action is linked to the Sleaze Attribute. You attempt to use a backdoor you have put in place to gain illicit entry into a host, device, or other Matrix area. This action can only be used if you have previously used Probe on the target suc- cessfully; net hits from that successful Probe count as a dice-pool bonus on this test. If the test is suc- cessful, you gain Admin access to the target, and it does not count as illegal Admin access (though taking illegal Matrix Actions will still increase your Overwatch Score). If this test fails, the back- door you have made was detected and removed, and you cannot attempt Backdoor Entry again with the same host until a new backdoor is made through the Probe Action. Failing this test does not immediately set off alarms, but the character’s OS increases as normal.

effects: []
system:
  description: This action is linked to the Attack attribute. You directly attack a device, flooding it with re- quests, commands, queries, and other junk code in order to create an exploit to give you access. Brute Force is by far the fastest way to gain illicit access to a device, but it carries with it many risks. Using Brute Force will always alert the device you are at- tempting to gain access to, so GOD score accumu- lates with each test. Should you fail a Brute Force attempt to gain access, you may attempt another on the next combat round.     If the hacker is attempting to gain User or Admin access, the opposed roll is Willpower + Firewall. When attempting to gain Admin access without first having gained User access, the opposed roll is Will- power + (Firewall + 2), and the target is granted a +4 bonus to their Defense Rating for that Test.

effects: []
system:
  description: This action allows extended remote control of a device. You maintain control until you relin- quish command or are forced out of the system. While you have control, you can use the device as if you were the owner using a standard skill test, including turning the device off if you have Admin access. If there is no test associated with the device you wish to use, use Electronics + Logic vs. Firewall + Willpower. This test assumes you are using the device directly, not command- ing a device to use another (such as commanding a drone to fire its weapon). A Control Device action versus a device currently “jumped into” by a rigger automatically fails.     When you use Control Device, you may take any action that would normally require the level of access you currently have. Hacking User access allows you to take any action that would normally require legitimate User access. Actions that nor- mally require legitimate Admin access will likewise require hacked Admin access to perform. The Attributes you’ll use for Control Device Tests may change based on whether you are in AR or VR while using it. If you are using a device via Augmented Reality, and the de- vice requires a Physical attribute, use your normal Physical attribute for this test. If you are using this device via Virtual Reality, and the device requires a Physical attribute, substi- tute the appropriate Mental attribute for this test. (Body = Willpower, Agility = Logic, Reaction = Intuition, Strength = Charisma).

  description: Edit File allows you to create, change, copy, delete, or protect any kind of file. The defender is either the host holding the file or the owner of the file (if it’s not on a host). Each action is enough to alter one detail of a file—a short paragraph of text, a single detail of an image, or two or three seconds of video or audio (you and your gamemaster can work out what exactly “one detail” means). Your gamemaster may impose penalties on the test if your edit is particularly intricate or tricky. If you want to perform a continuous edit, such as removing your teammates from a video feed, you need to perform this action once per combat round for as long as you want to keep the edit going. If you use this action to copy a file, you are the new file’s owner. If the file you want to copy has protection on it, this action automatically fails. If the file has a Data Bomb, the Data Bomb goes off on you (so try to remember to scan files before you open them).

system:
  description: This is a specialized Matrix search, made illegal by the fact that it searches for an encrypted file by matching it to a hash value (GOD does not appreciate people trying to skirt encryption). By searching for a specific value, the characters can find an encrypted document on a host or device without first having to decrypt every document to find the right one. This works best if Mr. Johnson provided the hash value to them, but in a pinch the search can be done with the character’s best guess. The threshold is 1 if you have a hash value from Mr. Johnson or some other source, 4 if you are doing the best on your own. Meeting the threshold means you have narrowed the number of possibly matching files down to 32; for every net hit, that number is divided in half (so there are 16 files with 1 net hit, 8 with 2, etc.). If the number of possible matches still seems too large after the initial test, the test can be repeated with the –2 dice pool penalty for repeating an action (see p. 36). Success on this subsequent test, along with any net hits, serves to divide the number of possible matches in half.

A file can only have one Data Bomb on it at a time. The Data Bomb is triggered when someone attempts to read, edit, copy, protect, delete, or place another Data Bomb on the file without disarming the Data Bomb that’s already in place. When a Data Bomb goes off, it causes (Rating x 2) Matrix Damage (resisted with Willpower) to the icon that tripped it, deletes the file (if it was set that way), and then is itself deleted. If the passcode is used, the Data Bomb doesn’t activate. Instead, it remains attached to the file, waiting for the next guy. A Data Bomb can be detected using Matrix Perception. If it’s detected, it can be defused with the Disarm Data Bomb action; a disarmed Data Bomb is deleted.'

If you succeed in making this attack, do (1 + net hits) damage to the icon you attacked while also reducing their Data Processing rating by the same amount. If a device’s Data Processing rating is reduced to 0, the user cannot perform a Matrix action until it is 1 or more. The Data Processing rating recovers at a rate of 1 point per combat round.'

  description: Blaster IC isn’t fun, but at least it’s not as focused on killing you as Black IC is. Yeah, it might want to subject you to all sorts of unpleasant Matrix-based torture, but you have to be alive to experience pain, so that’s something, right? In cyber-combat, this does (Rating) Matrix damage while also link-locking the target.

data:
  description: A character gains a +1 dice pool bonus with the use of this action. The action can only be taken once per combat round, but if the bonus is not used, it carries over to the next combat round, allowing it to be combined with actions taken over the course of several combat rounds. If the character takes a player turn without taking the Take Aim or Attack actions, any carryover bonuses from previous rounds are lost. The maximum dice pool bonus from the use of this action is equal to the characterâ€™s Willpower. A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow, or exotic ranged weapon. If the character is using vision magnification or a targeting scope, the Take Aim action must be used to line up the shot in order to receive any bonus from the item. In this case, the first action of Take Aim does not provide any additional bonus beyond enabling the function of the modification.

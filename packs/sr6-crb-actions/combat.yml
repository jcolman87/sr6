  description: A character can use this action when it is not their player turn to get away from an incoming Blast or Gas attack. With this action, a character makes a Reaction + Athletics – Dodge Penalty roll (see Dodge Penalty table, p. 311, for these values). Hits on the test allow a character to move a number of meters equal to their hits in a direction of their choosing, but they shouldn’t know the results of the scatter until after they decide which way they’re headed. If they choose to move more than 2 meters, they dive to the ground at the end of their defense and gain the Prone status. This action cannot be used if the character has taken a previous Avoid Incoming, Move, or Sprint action this combat round and prevents the use of another Avoid Incoming, Move, or Sprint action for the remainder of the combat round.

system:
  description: 'Counterspelling is the equal and opposite reaction to spellcasting. Magicians give benefits through spells, while other magicians use their gifts to take them the hell away. Counterspelling is a spellcaster’s quick reaction defense, and it comes in one of two forms: boosted defense and dispelling.

  Boosted Defense
  This is the pre-emptive defense, where spellcasters try to block an incoming spell. To use it, characters take a Counterspell Major Action and roll a Sorcery + Magic test. At its base, the action affects a sphere in the caster’s LOS with a two-meter radius (the radius can be increased by 1 meter per dram of reagents spent). Net hits on the test are added to the dice pool of anyone in the area to defend against any spells. This boost lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the Magic of the spellcaster.

  Dispelling
  This is for use against spells that are sustained or otherwise have ongoing effects. The character chooses the Counterspell action and then rolls Sorcery + Magic vs. Drain Value of the spell x 2 (including any adjustments made to the spell when it was cast). Net hits on this test cancel net hits on the spell on a one-to-one basis; when net hits reach zero, the spell is completely dispelled. '

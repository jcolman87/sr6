You feel no pain—you’re blissfully, dangerously, recklessly unaware of the extent of damage you’ve taken without either performing a self-examination (Observe in Detail action) or being informed by a biomonitor (p. 281). While active, the pain editor increases your Willpower by 1 and decreases your Intuition by 1; additionally, all tactile Perception tests you make have their threshold increased by 1.'

You need less sleep per day, and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from). The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night, and you can stay awake for twice as long as normal without acquiring the Fatigued status (p. 52). Resting hours for healing purposes are not affected.'

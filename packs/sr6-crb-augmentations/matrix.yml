  description: 'The emergence of technomancers gave rise to new encryption schemes used by most corporations in the Matrix. To deal with these encryptions, a new type of cyberware was developed, incorporating the processing power of the metahuman mind. Cyberjacks are a fairly invasive piece of gear, implanted deep into the brain, and meant to interface more smoothly with a cyberdeck. While they can act as a simple datajack, they also perform the function of integrating the ASIST interface more directly, thus providing superior speed and response times.'

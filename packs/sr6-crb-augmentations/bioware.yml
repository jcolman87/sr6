  description: 'This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure test (p. 67); otherwise you can trigger it as a Minor Action. While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers, don’t fall unconscious even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled, you can’t rest, and the adrenaline pump’s rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for (rating x 1D6) combat rounds, and it can’t be switched off early. When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to one half, rounded up, of the number of combat rounds the pump was active (use unaugmented Body to resist the damage). After the effect’s end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires one hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated. '

Ligaments are strengthened, and the greater bone density increases your weight by fifteen percent. You gain its rating as extra Body when resisting physical damage.

Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to bones, including bone lacing cyberware. '

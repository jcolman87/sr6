description: 'Some magicians channel their arcane powers through their mentor spirit. In turn, as part of their action, the totem begins to manifest itself through a visible, temporary transformation (animalistic features, elemental effects, etc.). The transformation is mana-based, so only living beings catch the transformation. The more successes in the magic test, the more pronounced the transformation and the more identifiable the totem is to even the mundane. Game Effect: The mage defines one effect (e.g., a translucent wolf’s face covering their features, their eyes glowing in arcane fire). This effect accompanies the use of any skill involving magic (or for adepts, every activation of an adept power). Investing a Minor Action (in addition to the action required in using the corresponding magical skill), the magician gains one Edge. This Edge is only temporary and can only be used for the test (Adepts: for the first test involving the activated Adept power). There’s a downside, too: the Shamanic Mask inevitably exposes the mage as Awakened. This may draw the enemies’ fire towards them, putting them in mortal danger. '

This interval cannot be reduced by any means—even by using an oracle data structure. Once complete, the profile is permanent— we can assume that you spend a few minutes here and there keeping your stored profiles up to date. The profile contains all the basic information the GM might provide as the result of successful legwork efforts, but it’s also useful when interacting with the individual. When you have a profile on someone, you gain a point of Edge on any Con, Influence, or Judge Intentions tests made against them. This Edge must be spent on the test or banked into the profile. Each profile can store up to 6 points of Edge. This Edge may only be used by you, and you may only use it on Edge Boosts and Actions made against the target. Edge from the profile can be spent on any kind of test against the profile’s target—not just Con, Influence, and Judge Intentions. Any Edge stored within a profile goes away at the beginning of the next session when Edge refreshes. '

description: 'If you spend some extra time with an off-theshelf device, you can make some unorthodox improvements. Game Effect: If you have the relevant toolkit, you can take any factory-manufactured device and improve it with an extended Electronics (Hardware) + Logic or Engineering + Logic test with a threshold equal to its Device Rating (or 4, whichever is higher) and an interval of 1 hour. The device receives a number of “upgrade points” equal to your Logic attribute. Any time you take an action using an upgraded device, you may spend an additional Minor Action to engage the upgrades and add one wild die for every upgrade point you spend. Upgrade points go away after they are spent. If any of those wild dice roll a 1, the device stops working after the action is resolved. If all of the upgrade points are spent, the device stops working in the same way. In both cases, getting the device to work again requires another extended Electronics or Engineering test as above, but with an interval of 1 minute. This restores functionality, along with a number of upgrade points equal to your Logic attribute. This cannot be used on devices that generate a persona, such as a commlink, cyberdeck, or RCC. Augmentations, drones, and vehicles are also ineligible for upgrades. Per gamemaster discretion, any other device (including weapons) can be modified. Just to be clear, using this quality on any device voids the manufacturer’s warranty. Note: You should prepare a few lines of handy technobabble to describe how your weird science boosts the equipment you upgrade with this quality. You don’t have to, but it will be much more fun for everyone if you do. '

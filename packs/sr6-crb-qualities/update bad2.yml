(Along the way, the spirit will display either a very twisty or snotty behavior, depending on the magician’s tradition.) A pusillanimous summoner has to be very precise about their wording, unless they don’t mind being given the runaround by the spirit. This quality can only be taken by characters who qualify for the Conjuring skill. Game Effect: Spirits summoned by the magician try their best to misinterpret the summoner’s orders (at the gamemaster’s discretion).

While many students, becoming more and more confident, overcome those techniques little by little, others decide to maintain them, finding them comforting and helpful. This quality is not available for adepts. Game Effect: The magician defines a clearly visible or audible act—gestures, spoken words, chants, and the like—that must be performed whenever they use arcane powers; alternatively, there’s a special garb or outfit (or even the total lack of any textiles) that must be worn. The act or garb can’t be casual or misinterpretable (e.g., as colloquial clothing or a fashion statement) but should raise suspicions, even with mundane people, that something mojo-related is going on. In the quality’s simple form (I), the magician can abstain from using their representation, but they have to accept a –4 dice pool penalty on all Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery rolls when not wearing the representation. In its more pronounced form (II), if the magician is unable to use their representation (e.g., because they are gagged, hands are tied, or the garb is removed), they are effectively hindered from performing any magic and cannot use the Astral, Conjuring, Enchanting, and Sorcery skills. Another drawback of this quality is that it points out to the magician’s enemies that they are the “dangerous one,” and if the enemies follow the old credo “kill the mage first,” this puts the magician in mortal danger. Along with all those downsides comes an upside; once per day, when the magician uses their representation while using arcane powers, they gain one point of situational Edge that can only be spent for that test.

description: 'You may have angered them with how you treat their fellows, killed a powerful and respected member of their kind, or been born under a bad sign and marked as an enemy to entities like them. The reason doesn’t matter—what matters is the fact that a certain type of spirit/sprite has an inherent dislike for you.  Game Effect: When selecting this quality, choose a type of spirit or sprite. Spirits/ sprites from that category gain a bonus point of Edge when you attempt a Conjuring or Tasking test against them. This quality can be taken multiple times, selecting a new class of spirits/sprites each time. In combat, spirits/sprites of the chosen type will attack you first and relentlessly, often to the point of savaging a dead body or bricking a deck if they have nothing else to do. '

description: 'Nervous tics, excessive caffeine intake, or a general clumsiness might be the cause, but the results are all the same: You can’t draw a straight line to save your life. You also have a real hard time typing, tying your shoes, and keeping a gunsight on the target.  Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge on any test using Agility that directly involves your hands (that is, a Stealth test to pull off sleightof- hand would directly involve the hands, as would an Attack test with any weapon held in the hands, but an Athletics test involving running would not, even though the hands are in motion while running).

description: 'Perpetual sniffles are annoying to both you and your team, but a poorly timed sneeze or a sudden need for a bathroom can mean the end of a good run. You’re sick almost all the time. It may just be a minor cold, or it could be a nasty case of influenza or worse, but you’ve never met an infection you didn’t want to take home and hang out with for a bit.  Game Effect: You cannot spend Edge to resist the effects of an infection. The threshold for fighting off any infection you are exposed to is increased by 1. While suffering the ill effects of an illness, you suffer a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests. '

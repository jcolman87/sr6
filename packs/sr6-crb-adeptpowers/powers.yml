description: 'Activation: Minor Action Some adepts are wells of furious mana and have learned to tap into that primal energy to enter a frenzied state that greatly increases their physical abilities. When this power is activated, the adept gains +1 to all their Physical attributes per level of Berserk (this bonus combines with other enhancements but is still limited to the usual augmented maximum of +4), ignores an amount of damage equal to their ranks in Berserk (as though they also had Pain Resistance at the same level; this stacks with existing Pain Resistance and other modifier amelioration), but suffers a –1 to all Mental attributes per level of Berserk (to a minimum of 1) and is a slave to their mindless aggression. These modifications affect most dice pools and Close Combat Attack Rating (Initiative, attack rolls, soak rolls, etc.), but not Condition Monitors. A berserk adept must make Close Combat attacks against a target in range or use Major Actions to close with someone in order to do so, every round (including friendlies or bystanders once they run out of opponents). The berserker frenzy lasts for (Berserk Levels x 2) rounds. If the adept wishes to leave this aggressive state early (in order to retreat or because their opponents are all down, for instance) they must roll an Adept Drain test (Body + Willpower, or as appropriate for their way) and score hits equal to their ranks in the Berserk power. When the power expires, either naturally or through a voluntary withdrawal, the adept must resist drain equal to (2 x ranks in this power), using their regular (non-Berserk) drain attributes. '

description: 'Activation: Major Action (see below) Adepts can, in times of crisis, link their health to that of an injured person, and pull the target’s injuries into their own body along this powerful, and painful, conduit. The adept begins the Empathic Healing process through physical contact with the target and a Magic + Willpower roll (threshold of 5 – target’s Essence). The adept removes 1 box of Physical or Overflow damage from the target per hit, simultaneously suffering 1 box of Stun damage for the first box of damage transferred this way, then Physical damage equal to the remaining boxes in future actions. Damage is transferred at the rate of 1 box per Major Action, during which time physical contact must be maintained. Injuries can only be affected once with Empathic Healing (but using Empathic Healing does not count toward the limit of one Healing spell per injury). Example: The team’s face has Essence 6 and has received 8 boxes of Physical damage from a rifle shot. The adept makes contact, spends a Major Action, rolls Magic + Willpower, gets 4 hits, then adds +1 hit for the target’s high Essence for a total of 5 hits. Immediately upon rolling, the face is lowered to 7 boxes of Physical damage and the adept receives 1 box of (unsoakable) Stun. During the next Major Action dedicated to the process, the face is lowered to 6 damage, and the adept takes 1 level of (unsoakable) Physical damage. If contact is maintained and the power is used for the full duration, at the end of the process the face will still have 3 boxes of Physical damage, and the adept will have 4 boxes of Physical damage and 1 box of Stun.

description: 'Activation: Minor Action Enthralling Performance lets an adept lace an artistic performance with magical power in order to mesmerize their audience and, in fact, put them into a relaxed hypnotic state. By investing a Minor Action to harness their power (in addition to the necessary action investment to perform with their instrument, dance, sing, etc.), the adept may then roll their appropriate skill/specialty + Magic, and their hits serve as a threshold modifier for any Perception tests their audience might try to make during the performance. Enthralled audience members may be distracted and entranced for a maximum of (Charisma + Magic) x net hits minutes, but viewers who are attacked, overtly threatened, or otherwise shocked out of it (an appropriately loud noise, sprinkler system or flash-pak going off, unsilenced gunshots, etc.) are snapped out of it early. Enthralling Performance defaults to Con/Performance specialty, but gamemasters may allow Influence/ Leadership for a rousing speech, Athletics/ Gymnastics for an impressive display, or even Close Combat/Unarmed for a kata routine, Stealth/Palming for distracting magic tricks, or other combinations as appropriate for the character, decided when it is purchased. It may be purchased more than one time for different Skill/Specialization combinations. '
